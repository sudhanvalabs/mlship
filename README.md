## Features

- ✅ **One-command deployment** - No configuration needed
- ✅ **Multi-framework** - sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace (local + Hub)
- ✅ **HuggingFace Hub** - Serve models directly from Hub without downloading
- ✅ **Built-in benchmarking** - Measure latency and throughput with `mlship benchmark`
- ✅ **Auto-generated API** - REST API with interactive docs
- ✅ **Works offline** - Zero internet dependency after installation
- ✅ **Fast** - Deploy in seconds, predictions in milliseconds

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install mlship

# Serve any model
mlship serve model.pkl
```

### Try HuggingFace Hub Models (No Files Needed!)

```bash
# Sentiment analysis
mlship serve distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english --source huggingface

# Test it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": "This product is amazing!"}'
```

**📖 See [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/sudhanvalabs/mlship/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md)** for complete hands-on examples with:
- HuggingFace models (sentiment analysis, text generation)
- Local models (sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Training code, curl commands, and expected responses

---

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework | File Format | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **scikit-learn** | `.pkl`, `.joblib` | `mlship serve model.pkl` |
| **PyTorch** | `.pt`, `.pth` | `mlship serve model.pt` |
| **TensorFlow** | `.h5`, `.keras`, SavedModel | `mlship serve model.h5` |
| **HuggingFace (local)** | Model directory | `mlship serve ./sentiment-model/` |
| **HuggingFace (Hub)** | Model ID | `mlship serve bert-base-uncased --source huggingface` |

**Note:** For custom PyTorch models, use TorchScript format (`torch.jit.save()`) for best compatibility.

---

## HuggingFace Hub Support

Serve models directly from HuggingFace Hub:

```bash
mlship serve gpt2 --source huggingface
mlship serve distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english --source huggingface
```

Models are downloaded on first use and cached locally. See [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/sudhanvalabs/mlship/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md) for more examples.

---

## API Endpoints

Every model automatically gets:

- **POST `/predict`** - Make predictions
- **GET `/health`** - Health check
- **GET `/info`** - Model metadata
- **GET `/docs`** - Interactive Swagger UI documentation

Examples in [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/sudhanvalabs/mlship/blob/main/QUICKSTART.md).

## Advanced Usage

```bash
# Custom port
mlship serve model.pkl --port 5000

# Development mode (auto-reload on code changes)
mlship serve model.pkl --reload

# Custom model name
mlship serve model.pkl --name "fraud-detector"

# Custom preprocessing/postprocessing
mlship serve model.pkl --pipeline my_module.MyPipeline

# Benchmark performance
mlship benchmark model.pkl --requests 1000

# Benchmark with JSON output
mlship benchmark model.pkl --output json > results.json
```

## Use Cases

**For Students & Learners**
- Learn model serving without framework-specific tools
- One tool works for entire ML curriculum (sklearn → PyTorch → transformers)

**For Data Scientists**
- Prototype models locally before production
- Test models with realistic API interactions
- Share models with teammates without cloud setup

**For Educators**
- Teach framework-agnostic model serving concepts
- Create reproducible examples that work across frameworks

Read [WHY_MLSHIP.md](https://github.com/sudhanvalabs/mlship/blob/main/WHY_MLSHIP.md) for detailed positioning.

## What Makes mlship Different?

mlship is the **only zero-code tool** that supports sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, AND HuggingFace models with a single command. Read [WHY_MLSHIP.md](https://github.com/sudhanvalabs/mlship/blob/main/WHY_MLSHIP.md) for detailed comparison with transformers-serve, vLLM, Ollama, and BentoML.

**Quick comparison:**
- ✅ Multi-framework (not just one)
- ✅ Zero code required (no Python files)
- ✅ Local-first (no cloud dependency)
- ✅ HuggingFace Hub integration
- ✅ Perfect for learning and prototyping

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ **Multi-framework support** - sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace
- ✅ **HuggingFace Hub integration** - Serve models directly from Hub with `--source huggingface`
- ✅ **PyTorch TorchScript support** - Full support for custom PyTorch models via TorchScript
- ✅ **Built-in benchmarking** - Measure latency (p50/p95/p99) and throughput with `mlship benchmark`
- ✅ **Zero-code deployment** - One command to serve any model
- ✅ **Auto-generated REST API** - With interactive Swagger docs
- ✅ **Custom pipelines** - Preprocessing/postprocessing support
- ✅ **Local-first** - Works completely offline (after installation)
